## Phi-2 Language Server
This project lets you use the Microsoft Phi-2 (or any other Huggingface model), from a local repository. The project includes an app to download the model and a language server to use it.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Run `save_model.py` to download the model
4. Run `server.py` to start the language server

### Usage
Once the language server is running, use the endpoint exposed (by default on port 5000), to hit the 'predict' endpoint.
